I know the assignment description says to only hand in "application" julia source code,
but because my application code uses the other code in "StateBasedSimulator" I wanted
to include it in case your "StateBasedSimulator" code is slightly different.
Hopefully there are no issues and you can just copy my applications folder
to yours, but if it does not run or there is weird behavior, consider testing
it with the code from my StateBasedSimulator.
