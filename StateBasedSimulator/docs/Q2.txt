########## Q2a ##########
The odds that the other coin flip results in tails is 0.25

From the simulator:
    The mean is about 0.25
    The confint is about (0.24989, 0.25006)


Based on theoretical possibe outcomes:

    1st     2nd
    flip    flip

            Heads 1/4 chance 
    Heads
            Tails 1/4 chance 



            Heads 1/4 chance
    Tails
            Tails 1/4 chance

The only possible outcome is Heads -> Tails which is 1 in 4 possible outcomes.
Therefore: 1/4 = 0.25 chance


########## Q2b ##########
The odds that the other coin flip results in tails is 0.50

From the simulator:
    The mean is about 0.50
    The confint is about (0.49989, 0.50009)

Based on theoretical possibe outcomes:

    1st     2nd
    flip    flip

            Heads 1/4 chance 
    Heads
            Tails 1/4 chance 



            Heads 1/4 chance
    Tails
            Tails 1/4 chance

This time we only know that there is one heads and one tails, but we don't know which
is first, so the possible outcomes are Heads -> Tails and Tails -> Heads.
Each of those outcomes have 1/4 chance so we add them together for 1/2 = 0.50

########## were they different? ##########
The two systems are different because the first model only has one possible outcome
while the second one has two possible outcomes, causing the probability to increase
from 1/4 to 1/2.
Looking at my results above you can see that my simulator confirmed this.
